## **Course Objectives**
This course provides the students with all the skills necessary to write efficient algorithms and large-scale software, so as to be able to solve complex and big data problems on parallel systems. The emphasis is on teaching concepts applicable across a wide variety of problem domains (including scientific modelling, statistics, machine learning, operations research and quantitative finance), and transferable across a broad set of frameworks. The goal of the course is to enable students to master object oriented and parallel programming methods that nowadays are necessary to produce software systems with industrial strength quality. The course covers Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, C++, and OpenMPI for parallel programming.

## **Contents**
This is a collection of my notes from the course. <br>
I marked with ✨ the documents that can be particularly useful.
