### 📚  Mathematical Engineering @Politecnico di Milano - Statistical Learning<br><br>

## **Course Objectives**
The course educates students to become professional data scientits by reviewing several statistical models, methods and algortihms aimed at the statistical analysis of mutivariate data. The aim is twofold: first, to provide future data scientists with the mathematical knowledge and understanding necessary for making proper judgments when selecting appropriate methods and algorithms, producing sensible interpretations of the results generated by their application and grasping their strenghts and weaknesses and, second, to enhace the students ability in applying the knowledge and understanding of the statistical approach to data analysis by emphasizing real life and engineering applications where statistical methods and modern computer packages permit to elicit information from multivariate data through complex statistical analyses.
