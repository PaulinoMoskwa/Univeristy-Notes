## **Course Objectives**
The goal of the course is to enable students to understand and be familiar with the Bayesian approach, its tools and main classes of models. This will enhance students’ abilities to address the statistical analysis of complex systems for which transversal and multidisciplinary skills are required. The Bayesian approach tells us how to update prior beliefs about parameters and hypotheses of a probabilistic model in the light of data, to yield posterior beliefs. In particular, Bayes' Theorem quantifies the problem of how to learn from data.
