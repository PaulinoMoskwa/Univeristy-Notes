## **Course Objectives**
Machine learning deals with the problem of building programs that learn from experience. While artificial intelligence focuses on the representation of knowledge and the algorithms for reasoning about such knowledge, machine learning deals with the problem of extracting knowledge from experience gathered solving problems to be used to solve unseen instances of similar problems. This course provides the theoretical and methodological foundation of machine learning methods and algorithms that are used in several application areas, including, Data Mining, Robotics, Autonomous Agents, Bioinformatics, Recommender Systems, Social Networks, etc.
