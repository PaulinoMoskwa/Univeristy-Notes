### 📚  Mathematical Engineering @Politecnico di Milano - Statistical Learning<br><br>

## **Course Objectives**
The purpose of the overall course is to present the main concepts and methods of discrete optimization and nonlinear (continuous) optimization, which allow to tackle a wide variety of decision-making problems arising in science, engineering and management. Modeling and application-related aspects are also covered. Optimization problems from, among others, data mining, economics, energy, healthcare, machine learning, logistics, production, telecommunications and transportation, are discussed.

## **Contents**
This is a collection of my notes from the course. <br>
I marked with ✨ the documents that can be particularly useful.
