## **Course Objectives**
This course aims to provide students with the knowledge of some topics of Mathematical Analysis. Such topics play an essential role, for instance, in Probability and Statistics (measure theory and integration) as well as in the modern approach to partial differential equations (Banach and Hilbert spaces, linear operators). The goal is to get students familiar not only with the results and their applications, but also with the technicalities of the proofs and the rigorous check of the hypotheses through examples and counterexamples.
