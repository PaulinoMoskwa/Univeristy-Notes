## **Course Objectives**
Modern complex industrial systems require a systematic approach to design and operation, with specified safety and reliability constraints/objectives (safety-based and reliability-based design and operation). The goal of this course is to provide the students with the adequate competences on methods and computational tools for the evaluation, the analysis and the control of the risk associated to the operation of industrial equipment and systems. These competences, typical of safety and reliability analysts and managers, are necessary in all modern engineering for the design and operation of safe and reliable systems.
