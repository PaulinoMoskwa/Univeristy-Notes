## **Course Objectives**
The aim of this course is to provide a simple and accessible introduction to discrete and time-continuous Markov chains, the simplest mathematical model for random phenomena evolving in time, with applications to queueing models, biological models, Markov chain Monte Carlo, reliability. Moreover, a wide variety of models will be illustrated to provide the student with useful tools to apply the methods in new situations. A brief introduction to martingale theory and methods with applications to Markov chains will also be given.
